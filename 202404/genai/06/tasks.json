The model uses only built-in TensorFlow operations to perform training with high-precision arithmetic. You want to update the code to run distributed training using tf.distribute.Strategy and configure a corresponding machine instance in Compute Engine to minimize training time.  What should you do?","tag":"Task 1"}],"uri":"us-west1-qwiklabs-gcp-03-0cc8f8e72505.cloudfunctions.net"}
