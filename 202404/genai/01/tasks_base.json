            "question": "Anonymous users from all over the world access a public health information website hosted in an on-premises EHR data center. The servers that host this website are older, and users are complaining about sluggish response times. There has also been a recent increase of distributed denial-of-service attacks toward the website. The attacks always come from the same IP address ranges. EHR management has identified the public health information website as an easy, low risk application to migrate to Google Cloud. You need to improve access latency and provide a security solution that will prevent the denial-of-service traffic from entering your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network. What should you do?",
