## Task 1. Create a dataset
bq mk --dataset bqml_lab

## Task 2. Create a model
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false \
'CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `bqml_lab.sample_model`
OPTIONS(model_type='logistic_reg') AS
SELECT
  IF(totals.transactions IS NULL, 0, 1) AS label,
  IFNULL(device.operatingSystem, "") AS os,
  device.isMobile AS is_mobile,
  IFNULL(geoNetwork.country, "") AS country,
  IFNULL(totals.pageviews, 0) AS pageviews
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_*`
WHERE
  _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20160801' AND '20170631'
LIMIT 100000;'

## Task 3. Evaluate the model

bq query --use_legacy_sql=false \
'#standardSQL
SELECT
  *
FROM
  ml.EVALUATE(MODEL `bqml_lab.sample_model`, (
SELECT
  IF(totals.transactions IS NULL, 0, 1) AS label,

  `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_*`
WHERE
  _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20170701' AND '20170801'));'

## Task 4. Use the model

bq query --use_legacy_sql=false \
'#standardSQL
SELECT
  country,
  SUM(predicted_label) as total_predicted_purchases

  ml.PREDICT(MODEL `bqml_lab.sample_model`, (

bq query --use_legacy_sql=false \

LIMIT 10;'

## Task 5. Test your understanding
### BigQuery is a fully-managed enterprise data warehouse that enables super-fast SQL queries.
### Which option best describes what BigQuery ML does?
#### Exports data from the warehouse, reformats the data, then executes the model using standard SQL queries.
#### Creates machine learning models using Python or Java in BigQuery, then executes the model using standard SQL queries.
#### Creates and executes machine learning models in BigQuery using standard SQL queries.
#### Creates machine learning models so you can export and use the model to re-evaluate the accuracy of other models.
